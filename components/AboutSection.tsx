          David Willis (1938–2020) was an American sculptor and painter whose career spanned five decades and four continents. Born in Greenfield, Massachusetts, Willis discovered his artistic calling after classical voice training led him to a scholarship at the Conservatory in Naples, Italy in the 1960s.

          It was in Europe during the 1970s that Willis began sculpting—transforming raw materials into expressive forms that would define his life&rsquo;s work. Living throughout Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Taiwan, he absorbed diverse cultural influences while maintaining a distinctive artistic vision rooted in organic forms, spiritual themes, and the human condition.

          His work gained institutional recognition with exhibitions in Bad Kreuznach and Stuttgart, Germany, culminating in his 1988 solo exhibition &ldquo;The Spirit of Asia in Coral&rdquo; at the prestigious Taipei Fine Arts Museum. Despite international acclaim, Willis remained devoted to creation over commerce, rarely selling works and instead building what would become a comprehensive archive of his artistic evolution.

          From the 1990s until his passing in 2020, Willis worked daily from his Florida studio, producing an extraordinary body of sculptures and paintings. His estate collection represents an unprecedented opportunity to acquire works spanning his entire mature period—a rare archive preserved intact by his family.
